# End-to-end-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-project-for-PDF-Question-Answering
This repository contains my hands-on project implementing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
It is inspired by the DeepLearning.AI course and demonstrates how to build a **PDF Question Answering system**.

## 📌 Features
- 📄 PDF ingestion and text chunking  
- 🔍 Embedding & vector database (Weaviate / Chroma)  
- 🤖 Retriever + LLM pipeline  
- ✅ Evaluation using RAG Triad (context relevance, groundedness, answer relevance)  
- 🖥️ Simple UI with Streamlit  

## 🚀 Current Status
🔧 Project initialization — setting up repo and environment.  

## 🎯 Goal
Deliver a polished GitHub project showcasing my RAG skills and deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.
